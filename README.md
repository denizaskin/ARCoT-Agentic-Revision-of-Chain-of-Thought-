**ARCoT: Agentic Revision of Chain-of-Thought**

üìö **Overview**

Traditional agentic workflows such as ReACT, Auto-GPT, and Self-RAG focus on revising queries or executing subplans but lack access to the internal reasoning (Chain-of-Thought, CoT) of the language model.
The release of DeepSeek-r1 has introduced open access to CoT reasoning, allowing researchers to directly revise the thought processes behind answers.

ARCoT (Agentic Revision of Chain-of-Thought) introduces a novel agentic workflow that not only critiques the outputs of an LLM but iteratively revises the chain-of-thought reasoning itself when an error is detected.

This results in a dramatically enhanced accuracy, explainability, and robustness of LLM-based systems.

‚∏ª

üéØ **Motivation**

- **Why Revise Reasoning Instead of Prompts?**
 
Directly improving reasoning pathways addresses flaws at their source rather than relying on surface-level prompt engineering.

- **New Capabilities Unlocked by DeepSeek-r1**
The exposure of explicit CoT reasoning allows for step-wise inspection, judgment, and targeted revision ‚Äî a critical advancement over black-box LLM outputs.

- **Agentic Refinement of Reasoning**
By embedding a Judge-Agent and a Revision-Agent within the workflow, ARCoT enables autonomous refinement of CoT until a correct answer is produced.

1. **Question-Answering Agent:**
Generates an initial answer alongside an explicit chain-of-thought.

2.	**LLM-as-a-Judge Agent:**
Evaluates the answer and the chain-of-thought, producing:
```bash
- Status (Correct, Incorrect, Partial)
- Detailed feedback
- Retainable elements from reasoning
- Chain-of-Thought Revision Agent:
- Revises the flawed CoT using judge feedback while retaining good elements.
```
4. **Answer Regeneration Agent:**
- Generates a new answer based on the revised CoT.
5. **Iteration:**
- Repeat the process until the answer is judged correct or the workflow halts.
  
‚∏ª

üìà **Example Workflow Execution**
	‚Ä¢	**Initial Run:**
The agent answers a question incorrectly due to flawed CoT.
	‚Ä¢	**Judge Output:**
Identifies logical inconsistencies and suggests improvements.
	‚Ä¢	**Revision Cycle:**
CoT is revised, emphasizing corrections without discarding valuable reasoning steps.
	‚Ä¢	**Answer Regeneration:**
A more accurate and robust answer is generated.
	‚Ä¢	**Final Output:**
If judged Correct, the workflow terminates; otherwise, it repeats refinement.

‚ú® **Key Innovations**
	‚Ä¢	CoT-Aware Critiquing and Revision:
First practical framework for autonomous chain-of-thought refinement.
	‚Ä¢	Feedback-Guided Self-Correction:
Agents systematically incorporate judge feedback to improve answers.
	‚Ä¢	Reduced Overreliance on Prompt Engineering:
Direct modification of thought processes rather than superficial prompt tweaking.
	‚Ä¢	Scalable Iterative Reasoning:
ARCoT workflow can be expanded to multi-agent debates and collaborative revisions.

‚∏ª

üìä **Experimental Results**
- In verbal reasoning benchmarks (e.g., Northeastern University‚Äôs Verbal Reasoning Challenge), ARCoT outperformed standard single-run DeepSeek-r1 even with lower token budgets.
- Improved handling of multi-step reasoning tasks where single-shot LLM outputs often fail.

‚∏ª

üöÄ **Future Directions**
- Integrating Retrieval-Augmented CoT Revision.
- Applying Multi-Agent Critique and Consensus.
- Extending to Complex Reasoning Benchmarks beyond verbal logic (e.g., symbolic math, program synthesis).

‚∏ª

ARCoT represents a paradigm shift:
Instead of trying new prompts when LLMs fail, we teach the model to revise its reasoning ‚Äî just as human learners would.
